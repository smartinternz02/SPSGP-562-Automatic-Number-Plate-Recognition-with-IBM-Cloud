Automatic Number Plate Recognition with IBM Cloud
Number Plate Recognition System is an image processing technology which uses number (license) plate to identify the vehicle. 
The objective is to build a web application that can efficient automatic authorized vehicle identification system by using the vehicle number plate.
Number plate recognition (NPR) can be used in various fields such as vehicle tracking, traffic monitoring, automatic payment of tolls on highways or bridges, surveillance systems, tolls collection points, and parking management systems.  

The escalating increase of contemporary urban and national road networks over the last decades emerged the need for efficient monitoring and management of road traffic.
Meanwhile, rising vehicle use causes social problems such as accidents, traffic congestion, and consequent traffic pollution.
